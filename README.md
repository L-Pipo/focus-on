## Scope of functionalities

### Overview view (/)

1. User can add a new day if the current day is not already in the database.
2. User can see number of completed tasks, number of completed pomodoro sessions and whether the given day was a success or not (that is when the user has completed every task that was set for the day).
3. With either a click on the card or a click on the button "Yes! Plan new day!" the view changes to the current day view.

### Current day view (/focus)

1. If there are already tasks for the day, the user can see the tasks and a decription of the tasks. He can also mark tasks as done and delete tasks.
2. The user can set new to-do's.
3. Pomodoro tracker with buttons for start, timeout/continue and reset and a noise for when the tracker is started or the user is done with the pomodoro session.
4. User can see how many sessions she already completed.
